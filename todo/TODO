1. Check and complete the pre/post conditions, particularly the finiteness of XPT, XOPT, STEP, X,
   etc.

2. Profile the Fortran code to find which subroutine costs the most time.
   We can use gprof and gprof2dot to to this:
   https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/08/gprof-tutorial/
   https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot
   $ gcc -pg main.f90
   $ gprof a.out gmon.out | gprof2dot | dot -Tpng -o output.png

3. 20230108: See TODO_mat

4. What about solving the TR subproblem of COBYLA using a composite step approach? Vardi or
   Byrd-Omojokun?

5. Check the definition and update of RESCON in LINCOA, in UPDATE/UPDATERES.

6. Unify the UPDATEQ, UPDATEXF(, and UPDATEH) of BOBYQA/LINCOA/NEWUOA.

7. Implement a subroutine that evaluates the functions, updates NF, updates history/filter, and
   prints messages?

9. Test whether the scaling threshold in the trust-region subproblem solvers can be improved.

10. For NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA, implement the trust-redundant subroutine solvers using hmul.
Update 20230301: This is not doable (cleanly) because we scale the data before starting the TR
calculation.

11. What about invoking RESCUE in the following way?

After a trust-region step, if the denominator is bad, set TO_RESCUE = .TRUE., but perform the
update as normal (if the denominator is 0 or NaN occurs, skip the update of H in UPDATEH).
Set IMPROVE_GEO and REDUCE_RHO to .FALSE. if TO_RESCUE is .TRUE. After a geometry step, set
TO_RESCUE to .TRUE. if the denominator is bad, but perform the update as normal. If TO_RESCUE is
.TRUE., invoke RESCUE, which can be regarded as a post-processing.

12. Output more history information in the way of outputting fhist, xhist, etc. This can include:
statehist: an array of length NF, each element indicating the state of the solver when the
corresponding function evaluation is invoked: 0 for initialization, 1 for trust region step, 2 for
geometry step, 3 for rescue.
radhist: an array of length NF, each element being the radius used by the solver for producing the X
where the corresponding function evaluation is invoked. Note that trust region step and geometry
step have different radii.
rathist: an array of length NF, each element being the ratio of the actual reduction to the
predicted reduction by the model for the step that leads to the corresponding function evaluation
ghist: an array of size N-by-NF, each column being the model gradient at the trust region center
when the corresponding function evaluation is invoked
jachist (only for COBYLA): similar to ghist, but for the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear constraints.
